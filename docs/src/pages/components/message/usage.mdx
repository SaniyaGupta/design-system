### Usage
<br/>

#### Non-dismissive
Messages are non-dismissive in nature. They appear with the rest of the components and cannot be dismissed directly.

#### Standard vs. Inline message
Inline message variant should be used when feedback relative to some specific content has to be provided to the users. Whereas, the standard message variant should be used when collective feedback for a section or an entire page has to be provided to the users.
