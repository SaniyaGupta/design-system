#### Our values

Values are like fingerprints, sticking to them will help us make better design decisions.

<Heading size='s'> Purposeful</Heading>

Biased for less. Every button, icon, or copy should have a purpose. Each step in a workflow.

<Heading size='s'> Data-Driven </Heading>

Personalized for users. Pre-fill options. Design for practices you want to promote.

<Heading size='s'>Friendly</Heading>

Approachable and friendly communication.

<Heading size='s'>Convention over Configuration</Heading>

Design for choices that are well thought out and based on best practices. Avoid unnecessary configuration. Avoid configuration to support fragile workflows.

<br />

#### Design principles

Our design principles constantly help us remain authentic, relevant, and original.

<br />

<Heading size='s'>
  Design for Repeatability and Reuse
</Heading>

We try to create our design elements as modules. This makes it easy for us to reuse them in combination with other elements.

<Heading size='s'>Create WOW Moments </Heading>

People love surprises. If you can make them smile, they are hooked.

<Heading size='s'>Keep it Attractive</Heading>

We believe people perceive attractive products as more usable (<Text appearance="link">The Aesthetic-Usability Effect</Text> ). So, we make sure our products look sharp.
